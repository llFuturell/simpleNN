# simpleNN
Two simple Neural Networks based on iamtrask. Using numpy only.

simpleNN.py contains a two layer neural network for a very direct relationship between input and output.
lessSimpleNN.py contains a three layer neural network that utilizes backpropagation for a deeper relationship between input and output.
